					<h3 style="margin-top:0px">What is MSScvm?</h3>
					<p>
						MSScvm (MSS clear-view-mask) is an automated cloud and cloud shadow identification system
						for Landsat MSS imagery. It is an important contribution to the field of large-volume Landsat
						image processing, as it provides an efficient means of identifying and removing cloud and cloud
						shadow pixels from inclusion in image mosaics, composites, and time series analysis.
					</p>
					<p>
						Similar cloud and cloud shadow identification systems for Landsat TM, ETM+, and OLI imagery have been developed and 
						have played a crucial role in facilitating the current trend of large-area and dense time series analysis.
					</p>
					<p>
						MSScvm was developed to provide the same service to MSS data so that it could more easily be incorporated with
						TM, ETM+ and OLI data to produce 42+ year spectral chronologies representing the longest satellite-derived 
						earth observation dataset. This extended record provides information on long-term Earth surface changes, 
						including forest dynamics, desertification, urbanization, glacier recession, and coastal inundation. It also has 
						the benefit of increasing the observation frequency of cyclic and sporadic events, such as drought, insect outbreaks, 
						wildfire, and floods. Furthermore, utilization of the full 42+ years of Landsat imagery sets an example of effectual 
						resource use and supports the need for continuity of Landsat missions to provide seamless spatial and temporal 
						coverage into the future. 
					</p>

					<h3>Why identify and mask clouds in satellite imagery?</h3>
					<p>
						Clouds and their shadows block or reduce satellite sensors' view of Earth surface features, 
						obscuring spectral information characteristic of clear-sky viewing. This spectral deviation 
						from clear-sky view can cause false change in a change detection analysis and conceals true 
						land cover, which can reduce the accuracy and information content of map products where 
						cloud-free images are not available. As a result, cloud and cloud shadow identification 
						and masking are important and often necessary pre-processing steps. 
					</p>
					<hr>

					<h3>How does it work?</h3>
					<p>
						The algorithm is specific to the unique spectral characteristics of MSS data, relying on a simple, 
						rule-based approach. Clouds are identified based on green band brightness and the normalized difference 
						between the green and red bands, while cloud shadows are identified by near infrared band darkness 
						and cloud projection. A digital elevation model is incorporated to correct for topography-induced 
						illumination variation and aid in identifying water.
					</p>
					<p>
						The MSScvm program is written in the R programming language and distributed as an R package for straightforward 
						installation and easy use.
					</p>
					<p>
						Besides creating cloud and cloud shadow masks, MSScvm will also prepare MSS images downloaded from 
						<a href="http://earthexplorer.usgs.gov/" target="_blank">EarthExplorer</a> by decompressing, stacking, and converting DN values to TOA radiance and/or reflectance.

					<h3>Application</h3>
					<p class="bottom_margin">
						MSScvm can be used as a stand-alone utility, but perhaps more significantly, it plays a vital role in the implementation of the <a href="http://landsatlinkr.jdbcode.com/index.html" target="_blank">LandsatLinkr</a> 
						program, which is an automated system for processing large volumes of Landsat imagery and building long spectrally consistent 
						chronologies across MSS, TM, ETM+, and OLI sensors. This is where the real benefit of the MSScvm program lies - check it out!
